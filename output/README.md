# Output folder

This folder stores all simulation outputs generated by `cli.py`.  
Outputs are **ignored by Git** (see `.gitignore`) since they can be very large.  

## Directory structure

Outputs are written to:

../output/<DISEASE>/<START_DATE>/<SURVEILLANCE_MODE>/<PARAMETERS>/

For example:

- `output/PRRS/2019_1_1/no_surv/no_surv/`
- `output/ASF/2019_1_1/slaughter_surv/num_sh_9/`
- `output/APP/2019_1_1/farmer_surv/farmer_prop_0.5_mort_rate_inc_0.02/`
- `output/PRRS/2019_1_1/network_surv/nets_250_90_d_t_i/`
- `output/PRRS/2019_1_1/sensitivity/phi_factor_2.0/`

## Standard output files

Each run produces some or all of the following CSVs:

- `results_by_compart_<RUN>.csv`  
  Daily totals by compartment across all farms (exposed, infected, asymptomatic, removed, recovered, isolated, quarantined, etc.).

- `results_by_contact_grp_<RUN>.csv`  
  Daily counts of newly infected/exposed pigs, grouped by contact type (`d`, `t`, `i`, `e`, `g`).

### Surveillance-specific files

- **Slaughter surveillance:**  
  `results_inspected_trans_<RUN>.csv` — transports to slaughterhouses inspected and discoveries made.

- **Farmer surveillance:**  
  `results_inspected_farms_<RUN>.csv` — on-farm detections triggered by mortality/morbidity.

- **Network surveillance:**  
  `results_inspected_farms_network_<RUN>.csv` — detections from testing farms based on network metrics.

## Notes

- `<RUN>` matches the `--curr_run` value you provided on the CLI.  
- Output directories are created automatically if they don’t exist.  
- File formats are CSV (NumPy-generated); column descriptions are in the main [README.md](../README.md).  
- You can safely delete old results here without affecting the code.
